# Modules
Help for all of the modules in LucidRAT

## Command and Control:

### orconsole
Since we have persistent ssh on our target computer, we can use `orconsole` [LucidRAT Console] to remotely access target in a command prompt. For linux syntax, type `powershell` in the orconsole.

### fix console
Because we are using ssh, we may need to add our target to our known hosts. So we can run `fix console` as a method to add it to our known hosts. That way we can use `orconsole` with ease.

### upload
The `uplaod` command allows us to remotely upload files to our target computer via scp.

### downlaod
The `download` command allows us to remotely download files off of our target computer via scp. This can also be reffered to as our `exfiltrate` module.

### restart
We can use `restart` to remotely restart the target computer. The reason why we have need this capability is to execute our malware initiated by the `startup` directory. Most modules will ask you to restart the target computer once malware has beento installed in order to execute it. It is suggested that you install the modules you think you will need and then restart the target computer [in order to avoid suspicion of your presence]

### shutdown
We can use the `shutdown` command to remotely shutdown the target computer.

### killswitch
The `killswitch` command removes LucidRAT and its persisetnce off of our target computer. Removing our malware in the `startup` and `temp` directory.

## Reconnaissance:

### install keylogger
The command `install keylogger` will remotely install our powershell keylogger on to the target computer. This program will allow us to keep a log of everything the user types on their keyboard. All logs are saved to a `<username>.log` file within the `temp` directory. We need to restart the target computer in order to execute the keylogger.

### install screencapture
The `install screencapture` command will install our program that will a screenshot of the users desktop every minute. We need to restart the target computer in order to execute the screencapture.

### install webcam
The `install webcam` command will install our webcam highjacking malware on to our target computer. This malware [when executed] will take a picture of the user through their webcam every minute. Please note that the light indicator on their webcam may flash when the photos are being taken. We need to restart the target computer in order to execute the webcam.

### grab keylogs
The `grab keylogs` command will grab the keylogs off of the target computer and into the attacker's `Downloads` folder. It will also wipe the logs off of the target computer so the file doesn't grow too large and raise suspicion of our presence.

### grab screenshots
The `grab screenshots` command will grab screenshots from our screencapture. It will save it to the attacker's `Downloads` folder and wipe the images off of the target computer to avoid suspicion.

### grab webcam
The command `grab webcam` will grab the photos that from that the attacker has taken through their webcam. The photos will be moved to the attacker's `Downloads` folder. The photos on the targets computer are removed to avoid suspicion of our presence.
